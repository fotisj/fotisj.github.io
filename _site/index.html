        <p>Many people use Juypter notebooks for their data science works. But it has been pointed out repeatedly that notebooks are detrimental to developing your programming skills, because they lack important features of standard integrated development environments like visual debuggers and support for refactoring. Another problem is that the notebook format doesn’t lend itself to do meaningful diffs, because the important differences get lost between all the lines showing output. This makes it more difficult than necessary to use notebooks in a collaborative environment. <a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext">Jupytext</a> is a tool, which remedies these problems. It allows you a lossless round trip between jupyter notebooks and python scripts. One simple way to achieve this is to convert your notebook into a python script, so that you can then edit and refactor the script - and then convert the script back to a notebook. The second approach is a bit more complicated: It allows you to setup your jupyter environement in such a way, that you will save a notebook now in two (or more) formats: the usual notebook format,  as a python script and / or as a markdown file. Changes to the python script in your preferred python IDE can be now played back to the notebook just by hitting the refresh button in the browser.</p>
